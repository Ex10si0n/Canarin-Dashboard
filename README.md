#### Areas: Sensors, data visualization, HCI

### Developer

Yajing Liu, Zhongbo Yan.

### Description: 

designing/developing an app, letting the users interact with a dashboard showing data collected by the Canarin II sensors and the different data it can sense: temperature, relative humidity, PMs, etc. The dashboard should show data of a single Canarin II or of a set of many Canarins II. Data visualization strategies should be adopted.

### Technologies: 

Sensors (already installed): Canarin II sensor
Map of the Cesena Campus (SVG based)
You can choose between web (responsive for mobile), native or hybrid app

## Issues

1. only one sensor
2. should we use the campus map
